# 😀HEY THERE!😄

If you are wondering what are POTDS... it just stands for Problem Of The Day 😎
GeeksForGeeks.com has these "POTDS" which we can solve to brush up our skills
of DSA and our problem solving skills by applying them to these Coding Problems everyday.

I had started solving Competitive Programming Problems from HackerRank, then switched to CodeChef and now I have been solving these POTDS of GFG for a while, 
and I got the idea 😴 of putting them in GitHub so I can see all of them at one place 😁.

Apart from this, I explain the concept behind these problems in my Blog https://stupendoushsc.blogspot.com 🙂
